# Advanced Bash for Offensive Security - Cheatsheet & Toolkit

![Bash Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Bash_Logo_PNG.png/640px-Bash_Logo_PNG.png)

A comprehensive Bash scripting cheatsheet and basic toolkit demonstrating robust, practical scripting techniques for Offensive Security operations. This repository serves as a learning resource and a foundation for building custom automation tools.

---

## üöÄ What's Inside?

This repository contains `advanced_bash_for_os.sh`, a single, well-commented Bash script that showcases a variety of essential concepts:

-   **Bash Strict Mode (`set -euo pipefail`):** Learn how to write robust scripts that fail early and loudly, preventing unexpected behavior. This is crucial for reliability in security operations.
-   **Intelligent Argument Parsing (`getopts`):** Understand how to build scripts that accept flexible command-line options (like `-t` for target, `-p` for ports, `-v` for verbose mode), making your tools versatile and user-friendly.
-   **Error Handling & Logging:** See how to implement proper logging to a file and console simultaneously, ensuring you have a full record of script execution, along with graceful cleanup on interruption (Ctrl+C).
-   **Core Bash Functionality:** A quick refresher on essential Bash elements including:
    -   Variables and basic input/output.
    -   Numerical and string comparisons.
    -   `for` and `while` loops for automation.
    -   Basic file operations (creation, listing, deletion).
-   **Offensive Security Tool Simulation:** Practical examples demonstrating how Bash can orchestrate common security tools (simulated for safety and learning):
    -   **Nmap Scan Automation:** How to structure a multi-stage Nmap scan.
    -   **Msfvenom Payload Generation:** Automating the creation of reverse shells.
    -   **Cron Job Persistence:** A common technique for establishing persistence on Linux systems.
    -   *Note: These are simulations to demonstrate scripting concepts; they do not execute actual attacks or generate real malicious payloads.*

## üéØ Why This Script?

-   **Learning Resource:** A perfect cheatsheet for beginners and a quick reference for experienced scripters looking to solidify their Bash skills for security tasks.
-   **Foundation for Automation:** Use the robust structure and function examples as a starting point for building your own custom reconnaissance, exploitation, or post-exploitation scripts.
-   **Best Practices:** Highlights crucial Bash best practices like strict mode and structured argument parsing, leading to more maintainable and reliable code.
-   **Practical Application:** Connects theoretical Bash concepts directly to practical Offensive Security scenarios, making the learning process more engaging.

## ‚ö° Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)*

2.  **Make the script executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x advanced_bash_for_os.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the script with options:**
    ```bash
    ./advanced_bash_for_os.sh -t example.com -p 22,80,443 -v -o my_scan_results
    ```
    -   `-t <target_IP/hostname>`: Specifies the target for simulated scans (e.g., `scanme.nmap.org`). **(Required)**
    -   `-p <port_range>`: Sets the port range for simulated scanning (e.g., `80,443` or `1-1024`). (Optional, default `1-1024`)
    -   `-v`: Enables verbose output. (Optional)
    -   `-o <output_directory>`: Specifies a custom base directory for all output files. (Optional, default `os_scan_results` in script directory)

    **Try it out:**
    ```bash
    ./advanced_bash_for_os.sh -t scanme.nmap.org -v
    ./advanced_bash_for_os.sh -t 192.168.1.100 -p 1-1000 -o /tmp/my_pentest_data
    ./advanced_bash_for_os.sh # See usage message
    ```

4.  **Test the cleanup:** Run the script and press `Ctrl+C` to see the `cleanup` function in action.

5.  **Review the logs:** Check the `script_run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log` file created in the script's directory for a full record of the execution.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Simulations

The "Offensive Security Tool Simulation" functions in this script are **for demonstration and educational purposes only**. They *do not* execute actual Nmap scans, generate real malicious payloads, or set up actual persistence. They merely create files and print messages to simulate the output of these tools, allowing you to focus on the Bash scripting logic without engaging in real-world security operations.

**Always ensure you have explicit permission before scanning or interacting with any system you do not own.**
